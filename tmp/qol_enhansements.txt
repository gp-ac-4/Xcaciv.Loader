- [ ]# Quality of Life Improvements Checklist for AssemblyContext

This checklist captures the proposed improvements to enhance the AssemblyContext implementation according to the SSEM framework attributes and best practices, as well as .NET 8/10 features.

## 1. Maintainability Improvements

### 1.1. Use Nullable Reference Types More Consistently
- [ ] Review and fix nullable annotations in `AssemblyContext.cs` (Lines: Throughout, especially ~10-300)

### 1.2. Improve Error Handling
- [ ] Replace generic exceptions with more descriptive ones in `loadAssembly` method (Lines: ~110-140)
- [ ] Add more context to exceptions in `CreateInstance` methods (Lines: ~155-190)

### 1.3. Enhance Method Separation
- [ ] Refactor `loadAssembly` method into smaller methods (Lines: ~110-140)
- [ ] Extract reusable logic from complex methods (Lines: Throughout file)

## 2. Trustworthiness Improvements

### 2.1. Add Stronger Path Validation
- [ ] Enhance `VerifyPath` method with additional security checks (Lines: ~245-260)

### 2.2. Add Logging
- [ ] Add structured logging throughout class (Lines: Throughout)
- [ ] Replace `Debug.WriteLine` with proper logging in `Unload` method (Lines: ~270-280)

## 3. Reliability Improvements

### 3.1. More Robust Exception Handling
- [ ] Fix warning suppressions in `ActivateInstance<T>` method (Lines: ~195-200)
- [ ] Add comprehensive exception handling in assembly loading (Lines: ~110-140)

### 3.2. Improved Resource Management
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup in all edge cases (Lines: Throughout, especially ~265-290)
- [ ] Implement IAsyncDisposable for better async resource management (Lines: ~280-290)

## 4. .NET 8/10 Specific Improvements

### 4.1. Use Modern C# Features
- [ ] Use `required` properties for mandatory initialization (Lines: ~30-40)
- [ ] Use `init`-only properties where appropriate (Lines: ~30-40)

### 4.2. Performance Improvements
- [ ] Optimize reflection usage with modern .NET APIs (Lines: Throughout)
- [ ] Use modern collection initializers (Lines: Throughout)

### 4.3. Implement Modern Interfaces
- [ ] Add IAsyncDisposable implementation (Lines: ~280-290)
